## A Fresh Start

After a few years of silence, I've decided to restart my technical blog.

This time I'm using:
- **Hugo** - Blazing fast build times
- **Stack Theme** - Clean, modern, excellent reading experience
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Free hosting, global CDN, automatic deployments

## What I Plan to Write About

1. **Infrastructure Upgrades** - JDK 25, Spring Boot 4.0, KEDA
2. **Incident Postmortems** - Lessons from production
3. **LLM Applications** - SQL Agent, JVM Analyzer, Code Review

## Why Start Again

> If these experiences and lessons can help someone, that would be great.

The most practical value of a tech blog is simple: I've stepped on this landmine so you don't have to.

*Stay tuned.*
