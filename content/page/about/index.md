## Liu Bo

A backend engineer working at a small company in China.

Nothing fancy here — just years of hands-on experience with Java, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, and the usual suspects.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Production war stories** — Real incidents, real fixes, real lessons
- **Backend development notes** — Things I wish I knew earlier
- **Occasional deep dives** — When a rabbit hole turns out to be interesting

### Why Write

Most problems I encounter aren't new. Someone else has solved them before. But finding that solution isn't always easy.

If my notes save someone a few hours of debugging, that's good enough.
