## Liu Bo

A backend-first engineer based in China.

I focus on Java/Spring backend systems, production debugging, and reliability — with experience spanning from mobile features to DevOps tooling.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Production incident write-ups** — What broke, why it broke, and how it was fixed
- **Backend and reliability notes** — Patterns, pitfalls, and trade-offs from real systems
- **AI tooling experiments** — Practical ways to improve engineering workflow

### Why Write

Most engineering problems aren't new, but useful context is often scattered.

If these notes save someone a few hours of debugging, that's good enough.
